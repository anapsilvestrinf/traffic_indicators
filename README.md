## Introduction
In this project, we will analyze a dataset available for download [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Metro+Interstate+Traffic+Volume). This dataset is about the traffic of cars moving from east to west on the I-94 Interstate highway, and our goal is to determine a few indicators of heavy traffic on this highway.
